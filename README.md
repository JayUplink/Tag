# Tag
Forked to fix some issues, Rayn322's has been updated since.
This project is no longer useful and therefore has been archived.
 

# Using the plugin
* /tag start <length of game in minutes (optional)> - Starts the game of tag. This will warp everyone to a random spot in the world. Whoever ran the command will be it first and the game will start after 3 seconds. If no length is specified the game will be infinite. Currently, no decimals are allowed.
* /tag stop - Stops the game and returns you to your original position.
* /tag here - Sets a specific location (x, y and z) for the game to start. 
* /tag border <size> - Sets the size of the world border.
* /tag coordinates <x> <z> - Sets coordinates to use. Leave blank for random coordinates.
* /tag reload - Reloads the config. It's recommended to change the config with commands rather than edit it manually.
