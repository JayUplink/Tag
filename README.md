# Tag
 A Minecraft server plugin that adds a game of tag.
 

# Using the plugin
To start a game of tag use /tag start <length of the game in minutes (optional)>.
This will warp everyone to a random spot in the world. Whoever ran the command will be it first and the game will start after 3 seconds.
If no length is specified the game will be infinite. Currently no decimals are allowed.

# Supported Versions
The plugin only officially supports 1.16 but may work with future versions and/or past versions.
