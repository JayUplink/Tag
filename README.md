# Tag
A Minecraft server plugin so you can play tag with your friends!
 

# Using the plugin
To start a game of tag use /tag start <length of the game in minutes (optional)>.
This will warp everyone to a random spot in the world. Whoever ran the command will be it first and the game will start after 3 seconds.
If no length is specified the game will be infinite. Currently no decimals are allowed.

# Supported Versions
Currently there are two different versions of the plugin. One supports 1.13-1.16 and the other supports 1.9-1.12.
